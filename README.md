# CruiseCoordinator

CruiseCoordinator is a full-stack web app designed to simplify the process of coordinating roadtrips. I first thought of developing a tool like this whilst planning my Spring Break in 2021. This was a multi-day, multi-vehicle endeavor that was very difficult to plan with such a large and varying group, and I knew that a tool like this would have vastly simplified the process.

Trip/Vehicle Logistics

... I'll elaborate on these features more as I continue to develop them
